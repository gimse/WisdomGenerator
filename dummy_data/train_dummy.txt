But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,Love like you'll never be hurt,Sing like there's nobody listening,And live like it's heaven on earth.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>You know you're in love when you can't fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>We accept the love we think we deserve.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>It is not a lack of love, but a lack of friendship that makes unhappy marriages.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, throbbing moment.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>You love me. Real or not real?"I tell him, "Real.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough..<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>Love is like the wind, you can't see it but you can feel it.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>If you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>You don't love someone because they're perfect, you love them in spite of the fact that they're not.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>We’re all a little weird.

And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness—and call it love—true love.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>The real lover is the man who can thrill you by kissing your forehead or smiling into your eyes or just staring into space.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>If I had a flower for every time I thought of you...I could walk through my garden forever.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears."After all this time?""Always," said Snape.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>I've been making a list of the things they don't teach you at school. They don't teach you how to love somebody. They don't teach you how to be famous. They don't teach you how to be rich or how to be poor. They don't teach you how to walk away from someone you don't love any longer. They don't teach you how to know what's going on in someone else's mind. They don't teach you what to say to someone who's dying. They don't teach you anything worth knowing.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>To die will be an awfully big adventure.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>So it's not gonna be easy.
